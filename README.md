# regressionplot

Using NumPy, MatPlotLib and Pandas, this repository implements simple regression models from scratch and visualises gradient descent alongside the cost functions.

The goal of this project was to improve on my understanding of these models, and practice using popular Python libraries for machine learning. The main library I wanted to learn in this project was MatPlotLib, as it will be useful in other machine learning projects and I had minimal prior experience in it. Using subplots and "animating" gradient descent using MatPlotLib is also a good way to gain intuition.

### Usage

You can visualise your own data by adding it as a csv in the samples directory, then creating the regression object with its path as the parameter.

The CSV formatting is hardcoded into each specific type of regression, so reformat the CSV following the documentation of each class.
